0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Background Context
-----------------------------------------------------------------
OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they
know about it :)). It’s VERY important that you read at least all
the material that is listed bellow. As usual, make sure you type
(never copy and paste), test, and understand all examples shown in the
following links (including those in the video). The biggest and most
important task of this project is the reading. The project itself will not
take you more than 2-3 hours if you take the time to read and understand
everything.
