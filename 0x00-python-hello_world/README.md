Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone,
without the help of Google:

General
Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today,
with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
Who created Python
Who is Guido van Rossum
Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
What is the Zen of Python
How to use the Python interpreter
How to print text and variables using print
How to use strings
What are indexing and slicing in Python
What is the official Holberton Python coding style and how to check your code with PEP 8
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the
holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo, containing a description
of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Shell Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
All your files must be executable
C Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4
using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style.
It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples.
You can use them to test your functions,
but you don’t have to push them to your repo
(if you do we won’t take them into account).
We will use our own main.c files at compilation.
Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included
in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
